Description: interactive high-level object-oriented language (default python3 version)
 Python, the high-level, interactive object oriented language,
 includes an extensive class library with lots of goodies for
 network programming, system administration, sounds and graphics.

Description: venv module for python3 (default python3 version)
 This package contains the venv module for the Python language (default python3
 version).
 .
 The venv module provides support for creating lightweight "virtual
 environments" with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system
 site directories. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (which
 matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment)
 and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site
 directories.

Description: 2to3 binary using python3
 2to3 is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and applies a
 series of fixers to transform it into valid Python 3.x code. The standard
 library contains a rich set of fixers that will handle almost all code. 2to3
 supporting library lib2to3 is, however, a flexible and generic library, so it
 is possible to write your own fixers for 2to3. lib2to3 could also be adapted
 to custom applications in which Python code needs to be edited automatically.

 Python 3 2to3 version (currently v@VER@).
